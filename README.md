EXPORTED TERMS
==============

This module exports terms (not subroutines), so you don't need to use parentheses to avoid block gobbling errors. Just use these same way as you'd use constant `π`

If you have to use parens for some reason, make them go around the whole them, not just the args:

    make-temp-path(:content<foo> :chmod<423>) # WRONG
    (make-temp-path :content<foo> :chmod<423>) # RIGHT

`make-temp-path`
----------------

Defined as:

    sub term:<make-temp-path> (
        :$content where Any|Blob:D|Cool:D,
        Int :$chmod,
        Str() :$prefix = '',
        Str() :$suffix = ''
        --> IO::Path:D
    )

Creates an [IO::Path](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path) object pointing to a path inside [$*TMPDIR](https://docs.perl6.org/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2ATMPDIR) that will be deleted (see [DETAILS OF DELETION](#details-of-deletion) section below).

Unless `:$chmod` or `:$content` are given, no files will be created. If `:$chmod` is given a file containing `:$content` (or empty, if no `:$content` is given) will be created with `$chmod` [permissions](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path#method_chmod). If `:$content` is given without `:$chmod`, the mode will be the default resulting from files created with [IO::Handle.open](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Handle#method_open).

The [basename](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path#method_basename) of the path is currently a SHA256 hash, but your program should not make assumptions about the format of the basename.

**Security Note:** at the moment, `:chmod` is set *after* the file is created and its content is written. This will be fixed once a way to create a file with a specific mode is available in Rakudo. While it will work at the moment, it might not be the best idea to assume `:$content` will be successfully written if you set `:$chmod` that does not let the current process write to the file.

`make-temp-dir`
---------------

Defined as:

    sub term:<make-temp-dir> (Int :$chmod, Str() :$prefix = '', Str() :$suffix = '' --> IO::Path:D)

Creates a directory inside [$*TMPDIR](https://docs.perl6.org/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2ATMPDIR) that will be deleted (see [DETAILS OF DELETION](#details-of-deletion) section below) and returns the [IO::Path](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path) object pointing to it.

If `:$chmod` is provided, the directory will be created with that mode. Otherwise, the default `.mkdir` [mode](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path#routine_mkdir) will be used.

Note that currently `.mkdir` pays attention to [umask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) and `make-temp-dir` will first the `:$chmod` to `.mkdir`, to create `umask` masked directory, and then it will [.chmod](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path#method_chmod) it, to remove the effects of the `umask`.

DETAILS OF DELETION
===================

The deletion of files created by this module will happen either when the returned `IO::Path` objects are garbage collected or when the `END` phaser gets run. Note that this means temporary files/directories may be left behind if your program crashes or gets aborted.

The temporary `IO::Path` objects created by `make-temp-path` and `make-temp-dir` terms have a role `Temp::Path::AutoDel` mixed in that will [rmtree](https://github.com/labster/p6-file-directory-tree#rmtree) or [.unlink](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path#routine_unlink) the filesystem object the path points to.

Note that deletion will happen only if the path was created by this module. For example doing `make-temp-dir.sibling: 'foo'` will still give you an `IO::Path` with `Temp::Path::AutoDel` mixed in due to how `IO::Path` methods create new objects. But new objects created by `.sibling`, `.add`, `.child`, `.parent`, etc won't be deleted, when the object gets garbage collected, because *you* created it and not the module. Of course, when a parent directory, that was created by this module gets deleted, all its contents that you created with `.child` gets removed from the disk. Siblings need to be removed manually.
